qpdfview is a tabbed PDF viewer using the poppler library.

It depends on libQtCore, libQtXml, libQtGui, libQtDBus and libpoppler-qt4. It is built using "qmake" and "make". It is installed using "make install".

The following build-time options can be set in qpdfview.pri:
- 'TARGET_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the application binary (default is '/usr/bin')
- 'DATA_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install application data like icons and translations (default is '/usr/share/qpdfview')
- 'LAUNCHER_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the application launcher (default is '/usr/share/applications')
- 'MANUAL_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the manual page (default is '/usr/share/man/man1')
- 'CONFIG += paint_links' enables the red rectangles drawn around links (enabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += render_in_paint' enables synchronous rendering, i.e. the interface will stall to render pages but it will update pages immediately (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += render_from_disk' enables multi-threaded rendering, i.e. the document file will be accessed concurrently which introduces I/O overhead and problems if the document file changes on disk but can improve rendering speed (disabled by default)

The project homepage is "http://launchpad.net/qpdfview". The project maintainer is "Adam Reichold <adamreichold@myopera.com>".

The action icons are from the tango project. The application icon is a combination of several icons from the tango project.
