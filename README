qpdfview is a tabbed PDF viewer using the poppler library.

The project homepage is "https://launchpad.net/qpdfview". The project maintainer is "Adam Reichold <adamreichold@myopera.com>".

It depends on libQtCore, libQtXml, libQtGui and libpoppler-qt4. It also depends on libQtSvg, libQtDBus, libcups resp. libz if SVG, D-Bus, CUPS resp. SyncTeX support is enabled. It is built using "qmake" and "make". It is installed using "make install". The installation paths are defined in "qpdfview.pri".

The following build-time options are available:
    * 'without_svg' disables SVG support, i.e. fallback and application-specific icons will not be available.
    * 'without_sql' disables SQL support, i.e. restoring tabs, bookmarks and per-file settings will not be available.
    * 'without_dbus' disables D-Bus support, i.e. the '--unique' command-line option will not be available.
    * 'without_cups' disables CUPS support, i.e. the program will attempt to rasterize the document instead of requesting CUPS to print the document file.
    * 'without_synctex' disables SyncTeX support, i.e. the program will not perform forward and inverse search for sources.

The fallback and application-specific icons are from the tango icon theme available at "http://tango.freedesktop.org".
