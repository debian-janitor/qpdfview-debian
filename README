qpdfview is a tabbed PDF viewer using the poppler library.

The project homepage is "http://launchpad.net/qpdfview". The project maintainer is "Adam Reichold <adamreichold@myopera.com>".

It depends on libQtCore, libQtXml, libQtGui and libpoppler-qt4. It also depends on libQtDBus/libcups if D-Bus/CUPS support is enabled. It is built using "qmake" and "make". It is installed using "make install".

The following build-time options can be set in qpdfview.pri:
- 'TARGET_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the application binary (default is '/usr/bin')
- 'DATA_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install application data like icons and translations (default is '/usr/share/qpdfview')
- 'LAUNCHER_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the application launcher (default is '/usr/share/applications')
- 'MANUAL_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the manual page (default is '/usr/share/man/man1')
- 'CONFIG += without_svg' disables SVG support used to display fallback and application-specific icons (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += without_dbus' disables the D-Bus support, i.e. the '--unique' command-line option will not be available (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += without_cups' disables the CUPS support, i.e. the program will attempt to rasterize the document instead of requesting CUPS to print the document file (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += render_in_paint' enables synchronous rendering, i.e. the interface will stall to render pages but it will display pages immediately and bypass the page cache reducing memory usage (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += render_from_disk' enables multi-threaded rendering, i.e. the document file will be accessed concurrently which introduces I/O overhead and problems if the document file changes on disk but can improve rendering speed (disabled by default)

The toolbars can be configured by setting the keys "fileToolBar", "editToolBar" and "viewToolBar" in the section "mainWindow" of the configuration file (usually located at "~/.config/qpdfview/qpdfview.conf") to an ordered comma-separated list. The default (available) entries are:
- fileToolBar: openInNewTab,refresh (open,saveCopy,print)
- editToolBar: currentPage,numberOfPages,previousPage,nextPage 
(firstPage,lastPage,jumpToPage,search)
- viewToolBar: scaleFactor,zoomIn,zoomOut (onePage,twoPages,oneColumn,twoColumns,fitToPage,fitToPageWidth,doNotScale,rotateLeft,rotateRight,fullscreen,presentation)

The icons are from the tango icon theme "http://tango.freedesktop.org".
