qpdfview is a tabbed PDF viewer using the poppler library.

The project homepage is "http://launchpad.net/qpdfview". The project maintainer is "Adam Reichold <adamreichold@myopera.com>".

It depends on libQtCore, libQtXml, libQtGui and libpoppler-qt4. It also depends on libQtSvg, libQtDBus resp. libcups if SVG, D-Bus, resp. CUPS support is enabled. It is built using "qmake" and "make". It is installed using "make install".

The following build-time options can be set in qpdfview.pri:
- 'TARGET_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the application binary (default is '/usr/bin')
- 'DATA_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install application data like icons and translations (default is '/usr/share/qpdfview')
- 'LAUNCHER_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the application launcher (default is '/usr/share/applications')
- 'MANUAL_INSTALL_PATH' sets the path to install the manual page (default is '/usr/share/man/man1')
- 'CONFIG += without_svg' disables SVG support used to display fallback and application-specific icons (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += without_dbus' disables the D-Bus support, i.e. the '--unique' command-line option will not be available (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += without_cups' disables the CUPS support, i.e. the program will attempt to rasterize the document instead of requesting CUPS to print the document file (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += render_in_paint' enables synchronous rendering, i.e. the interface will stall to render pages but it will display pages immediately and bypass the page cache reducing memory usage (disabled by default)
- 'CONFIG += render_from_disk' enables multi-threaded rendering, i.e. the document file will be accessed concurrently which introduces I/O overhead and problems if the document file changes on disk but can improve rendering speed (disabled by default)

The icons are from the tango icon theme "http://tango.freedesktop.org".
