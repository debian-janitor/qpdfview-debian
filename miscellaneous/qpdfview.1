.SH NAME
qpdfview \- tabbed PDF viewer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qpdfview
.I [options] [file(s)[#page[#top]]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qpdfview
is a simple document viewer for PDF documents.
It uses the poppler library for rendering.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP --unique
If an instance of qpdfview is started with this option,
any files that are opened using this option afterwards,
are opened as tabs in this same window. If a file is
already opened in a tab of the respective window, it is
merely reloaded using this option.
.IP [file(s)[#page[#top]]]
Specifies the files to open when qpdfview starts. If this
is not specified, qpdfview will open a blank window.
Multiple files can be loaded in separate tabs if the file
names are separated by spaces. The optional parameter
.I #page
opens the file at the given page. The optional parameter
.I #top
can take values between 0 and 1 and opens the page with
the given position aligned to the top of the tab.
(See examples.)
